<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The human-readable name of the resource. Values are case-sensitive.
- `resource_group` (String)

### Optional

- `account_discovery` (Boolean)
- `create_server_users` (Boolean) If `true`, 'sftd' (ASA Server Agent) creates corresponding local (unix or windows) user accounts in the ASA Project's servers.
- `forward_traffic` (Boolean) If `true`, all traffic in the ASA Project be forwarded through selected ASA Gateways.
- `gateway_selector` (String) Assigns ASA Gateways with labels matching all selectors. At least one selector is required for traffic forwarding.
- `next_unix_gid` (Number) The GID to use when creating a new ASA Server User. Default value starts at 63001.
- `next_unix_uid` (Number) The UID to use when creating a new ASA Server User. Default value starts at 60001.
- `password_settings` (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_settings))
- `rdp_session_recording` (Boolean) If `true`, enable remote desktop protocol (RDP) recording on all servers in the ASA Project.
- `ssh_certificate_type` (String) The SSH certificate type used by access requests. Options include: [`CERT_TYPE_ED25519_01`, `CERT_TYPE_ECDSA_521_01`, `CERT_TYPE_ECDSA_384_01`, `CERT_TYPE_ECDSA_256_01`, `CERT_TYPE_RSA_01`]. 'CERT_TYPE_RSA_01' is a deprecated key algorithm type. This option should only be used to connect to legacy systems that cannot use newer SSH versions. If you do need to use 'CERT_TYPE_RSA_01', it is recommended to connect via a gateway with traffic forwarding. Otherwise, please use a more current key algorithm. If left unspecified, 'CERT_TYPE_ED25519_01' is used by default.
- `ssh_session_recording` (Boolean) If `true`, enables ssh recording on server access requests.
- `user_on_demand_period` (Number) If defined, set time period in seconds that an on-demand user account exists on the server following an access request.
